Challenge 1 angular bootcamp
Had to create a visual studio project because Chrome needs a nasty parameter to read files from your pc if you aren't running it through something like visual studio iis express.
Made in visual studio 2015
Something like this should be the url for the index view http://localhost:56002/views/index.html
